/**
* Editorial: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/60047
* 
* Another solution:
* Find all the possibilities of the positions of the small spaceships and fill the 'answer' map.
* In such a way that for every possible position, we know the masks of the enemy spaceships that will be destroyed if we choose it.
* The masks will be a pair {a , b} where  0 <= a <= 2^n - 1  and  0 <= b <= 2^m - 1
* 
* A small spaceship's position(since it's X value is fixed to 0) can be defined by it's Y value which will = (X1*Y2 - X2*Y1) / (X1 - X2)
* That means that if we put a small spaceship there, enemy spaceships at (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2) will destroy each other.
* (i.e. them both and the small spaceship are aligned)
* X1 is always equal to -100 and X2 to 100.
* 
* To find for a single small spaceship position, what spaceships on the left and on the right will be destroyed;
* We need to look at all enemy spaceships, and the ones that will be destroyed(by each other through this small spaceship) will be
* the ones (i , j) such that (Xi*Yj - Xj*Yi) / (Xi - Xj) = small_spaceship_Y (value defined above) -- You can look at it in the way that
* we are checking if the intersection of the line (i,j) and the vertical OY axis is equal to the small spaceship's position or not.
* 
* Finally loop over all pairs of answers and find the maximum number of total destroyed enemy spaceships.
